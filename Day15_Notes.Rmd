## Central Limit Theorem for means

When we collect a sufficiently large sample of $n$ independent observations from a population with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, the sampling distribution will approach

$$\bar{X} \sim N(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})$$

## Central Limit Theorem for sums

When we collect a sufficiently large sample of $n$ independent observations from a population with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, the sampling distribution will approach

$$\Sigma X \sim N(n\mu, \sqrt{n}\sigma)$$
